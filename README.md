# Self--Assessment-
Final Project Self- Assessment 

Self Review- 
I learned so much by putting this "Big Picture" of everything we learned over the last 24 weeks into this project. I think for me the hardest part was grasping the 
machine learning on the model as that was a very difficult to get all the data as well as factoring if we would be able to answer our questions with baseball. 

Team Assesment- 
My classmates were amazing and together we all had enough knoweldge of each software on how to merge it all together and being able to put the outcome together. 

Our Project- 
For our project we did a sports analysis on which is the hardest pitch to pitch in baseball? 
What is the probability to hit a single, double, triple, and homerun for baseball? 
After completeing the project we found that you have the highest 65% chance to hit a single. Double is 20 % chance. A Triple hit would be 2.23% chance so small and so hard to hit a triple. Then for Homerun 12.61% Chance. 
Overall learning about baseball and building the model for this project was very fun and challenging as well as it showed that this class taught us the skills that we needed to learn and we grasped more than we thought we did when we all put our heads together.
